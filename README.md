# UFO Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this challenge was to use Javascript, HTML and CSS to create a web page using UFO data. This data was organized and several filters were applied, including date, city, state, country and shape. 

## Results

To perform a search through the data, users can input any descriptive information (exact match only) and the filter will pull any rows with that information. All rows not including the specified information are excluded.

## Summary

The main drawback to the web page is the need for an exact match. Users who try to enter with capitals or misspell search criteria cannot find the data they are looking for. A useful recommendation to enhance the web page would be a keyword filter, such that a user could search for specific words in the comment section, such as the word "red" or "bright". Additionally, more data can be added to the html file to enhance the visual appeal of the website, such as adding borders, giving a name to the table, or changing the font.
